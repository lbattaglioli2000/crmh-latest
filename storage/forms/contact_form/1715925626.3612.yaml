I apologize for using your contact form, \r\nbut I wasn't sure who the right person was to speak with in your company. \r\nWe have a patented application that creates Local Area pages that rank on \r\ntop of Google within weeks, we call it Local Magic.  Here is a link to the \r\nproduct page https://www.mrmarketingres.com/local-magic/ . The product \r\nleverages technology where these pages are managed dynamically by AI and \r\nit is ideal for promoting contractors on Google.  Can I share a testimonial \r\nfrom one of our clients with you?  I can also do a short zoom to \r\nillustrate their full case study if you have time for it? \r\ncody@mrmarketingres.com 843-720-7301"
