message: 'I am part of The Caring Closet-Guilderland where we provide hygiene products, including menstrual products to children and their families that are in need in the Guilderland School District. This is no cost to the individuals nor the schools and we partner with the social workers in the schools but all clients remain anonymous to our organization. We would like to possibly partner up to see what ways we may be able to do more or if there are ideas on how to get products at a possible bulk discount. I look forward to hearing from your group.'
