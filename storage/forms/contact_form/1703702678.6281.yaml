message: "Hello!\r\nI was wondering if you could clarify what you mean by \"unopened\": I have individually wrapped pads/ panty liners I'm looking to pass on, but their outer plastic \"bundle\" holding them all together has been removed. Is this acceptable, or just recently purchased \"sets\" of products?\r\nThank you!"
