We often have people who take a LOT of supplies at once--which is fine, they and their families need pads, that's what it's here for, I know how quickly a family can go through them.  But we also don't have infinite funding and infinite supplies, and if one person clears out half the stock it means other people go short.  Due to serious language barriers it's difficult to say \"Please take only a few\" or put up a sign along those lines.  Do you have any tips?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJane Mitchell"
