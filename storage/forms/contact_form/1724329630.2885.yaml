message: "Reversed Chakra bursts onto the indie music scene with \"Game of Chess,\" a track that entertains and invites listeners into a profound exploration of spiritual energy through music. This band stands out by challenging conventional norms, even embracing a philosophy that turns traditional spiritual energy flows on their head. The single showcases Reversed Chakra's talent for crafting a rich sonic landscape, blending introspective indie rock with the moody allure of new wave and the expansive soundscapes of post-rock. \r\n\r\nThis ambitious fusion creates a song that feels both familiar and refreshingly unique. Produced by Paul Reeve (Muse), mixed by John Fryer (Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, HIM), and mastered by Richard Dodd (Kings Of Leon), the single has reached 2.1 million streams in less than a month. We can easily shout that we are witnessing the rise of a new sensation in indie rock! \r\n\r\nEnjoy the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dw1T5TDecc\r\nVisit the band's website: www.reversedchakra.com"
