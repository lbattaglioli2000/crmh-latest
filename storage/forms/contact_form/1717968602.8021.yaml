message: "Hello, \r\nI met the team of NYS Public Health Corps Fellows at the S. Colonie School District 'Raiderfest' Mental Health Expo on 5/18/24.  I was introduced to the programs and discussed potential collaboration.  I have since shared information re: this initiative with members of the Community Reformed Church of Colonie's Advocacy and Global Mission Team of which I am a member.  The team is considering the possibility of featuring Menstrual Health and Equity in August.  Our team will be meeting this Tuesday 6/11/24 to make a decision.  We have the authority to make a $500 donation to an organization.  In addition to financial support, if we choose to support Menstrual Health we could approach our quilting group who might be willing to make pads (they would need directions).  Another possibility is to designate our 'Mission of the Month' in August to collect hygiene products for kits and local period pantries (what products are needed?).  If we pursue this direction I will write an article for our church newsletter that has to be submitted by July 15 for publication in our August edition.  Would you be able to supply resource materials for distribution during our worship services in August?\r\nAre you interested in receiving support, financial and/or material, from our team?\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.  Donna Davidson"
