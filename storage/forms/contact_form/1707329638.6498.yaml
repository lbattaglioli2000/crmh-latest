message: "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI work for the Food Pantries for the Capital District. I'm trying to confirm that the information I have for period pantries is still correct.\r\n\r\nI tried calling Family Self Sufficiency at 200 Green Street, Albany, NY 12202 but they said there is not a period pantry at this address. Did this pantry move to a new address? \r\n\r\n I haven't been able to reach anyone regarding the Trinity Alliance, Bethesda House, or SICM period pantries. Are they still at the addresses listed on your website and accessible 24/7? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTiffany Willsey \r\nReferral Specialist \r\nThe Food Pantries for the Capital District"
