The old newspaper vending box has been remade, painted purple and decorated with pictures and words that proclaim its purpose to all who pass by.  

The phases of the moon, encircled by a wreath of flowers, painted in crisp black-and-white. A uterus. An assortment of period products, hearts and teardrops floating around a statement: “Menstrual hygiene is a human right.” 

The contents of the box, called a period pantry, reflect this spirit.
