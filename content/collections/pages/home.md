          Individuals are able to access free menstrual products at their convenience via our Free Period Pantries. These small, outdoor, weather-protected containers offer a variety of period products in multiple sizes and absorbencies. These boxes are never locked and operate just like a Little Free Library or Little Food Pantry.

          **Our goal is to make it easy for individuals in under-resourced communities to access the period products they need, whenever they need them.**

          We believe that every person who menstruates should have access to the products and resources they need to manage their period with dignity and comfort. That's why we're accepting donations of period products and monetary donations.

          You can make a monetary donation that will help us continue to expand our Period Pantry network and provide essential menstrual hygiene products to those in need. If you'd like to donate period products, please contact CRMH for more information on how to make a donation.
